# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to streamline the process of converting technical diagrams into structured system requirements. It addresses the gap between visual system design and formal requirement documentation, providing a seamless workflow from diagram to actionable requirements.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Manual Transcription Inefficiency**: Eliminates the need to manually transcribe information from diagrams into text-based requirements.
2. **Inconsistent Interpretation**: Provides consistent interpretation of technical diagrams using AI.
3. **Disconnected Workflows**: Bridges the gap between visual design tools and requirement management systems.
4. **Traceability Challenges**: Creates traceable links between diagram components and generated requirements.
5. **Collaboration Barriers**: Enables easier review and modification of requirements derived from diagrams.

## How It Should Work
1. **Diagram Upload**: Users upload technical diagrams (architecture diagrams, flowcharts, etc.) through a Streamlit interface.
2. **OCR Processing**: The system extracts text from the diagram using OCR technology.
3. **Graph Construction**: A graph representation is built from the extracted components using NetworkX.
4. **Requirement Generation**: GPT-4 analyzes the graph and generates structured system requirements.
5. **Review & Edit**: Users can review, edit, and refine the generated requirements through an interactive UI.
6. **Export**: Final requirements can be exported in JSON format for integration with other tools.

The system should be intuitive, requiring minimal technical knowledge beyond understanding the input diagrams, and should produce high-quality, actionable requirements that maintain fidelity to the original diagram.
