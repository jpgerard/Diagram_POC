# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation has been set up
- Project structure has been created
- Core Streamlit application has been implemented
- All modules have been implemented:
  - Diagram upload functionality with direct file saving
  - OCR processing using DocTR
  - Enhanced OCR with specialized preprocessing for technical diagrams
  - Direct OCR that matches the test script approach
  - Graph construction (visualization removed)
  - Requirement generation with robust error handling
  - Review & edit interface for requirements
  - Export functionality for JSON and CSV formats
- DocTR integration for OCR has been tested and verified
- Direct OCR processing that exactly matches the test script approach has been implemented
- Test scripts for DocTR functionality have been created and verified

## What's Left to Build
1. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
   - Set up secrets management in Streamlit Cloud
   - Test the deployed application

2. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Address Streamlit button double-click issue
   - Test with various diagram types
   - Further refine OCR accuracy
   - Test OpenAI API integration for requirements generation
   - Enhance user experience

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Implement more comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Optimize performance
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement persistent storage

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Batch processing of multiple diagrams
   - Custom requirement templates
   - Integration with requirement management tools
   - Collaborative editing features
