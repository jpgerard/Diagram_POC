# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for the entire application
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for building the user interface
- **OpenAI API**: Used for GPT-4 integration and requirement generation
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: For extracting text from diagram images
- **NetworkX**: Python library for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graph structures

### Supporting Libraries
- **Pillow/OpenCV**: For image processing before OCR
- **Pytesseract**: Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR engine
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and storage
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For visualization of the graph structure
- **JSON**: For data serialization and export

## Development Setup

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+ installed
- pip for package management
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up OpenAI API key as an environment variable
5. Run the application with `streamlit run app.py`

### Development Workflow
1. Feature branches for new functionality
2. Local testing using Streamlit's hot-reload capability
3. Manual testing of the end-to-end workflow
4. Code review before merging to main branch

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations
- OCR processing may be time-consuming for complex diagrams
- OpenAI API calls have rate limits and latency
- Graph visualization performance may degrade with very large diagrams

### Security Considerations
- OpenAI API key must be securely stored
- User-uploaded diagrams should be handled securely
- Generated requirements may contain sensitive information

### Compatibility
- Supported image formats: PNG, JPG, PDF
- Streamlit compatibility with modern web browsers
- JSON export compatible with common requirement management tools

### Scalability
- Current prototype designed for individual use
- Future scaling considerations:
  - Batch processing of multiple diagrams
  - Persistent storage of projects
  - Multi-user collaboration features
