# Active Context

## Current Work
Completed the implementation of a prototype that demonstrates the full flow from diagram to requirements with an editable review UI using Streamlit. The prototype:
- Allows users to upload technical diagrams
- Extracts text via OCR using DocTR with direct processing that matches test scripts
- Builds a simulated graph of components using NetworkX (without visualization)
- Uses simulated requirements generation (OpenAI integration is prepared but disabled)
- Provides an interface to edit and export those requirements in JSON format

## Recent Changes
- Project initialization
- Created Memory Bank documentation structure
- Defined product context and workflow
- Set up the project structure with all necessary directories
- Implemented the main Streamlit application
- Created all module components:
  - Diagram upload module
  - OCR processing module (using DocTR for OCR)
  - Enhanced OCR module with specialized preprocessing for technical diagrams
  - Direct OCR module that matches the test script approach
  - Graph construction module (visualization removed)
  - Requirement generation module with robust error handling
  - Review & edit module
  - Export module
- Created README.md with project documentation
- Set up .env file for environment variables
- Integrated DocTR for OCR processing
- Created test scripts to verify DocTR functionality
- Added direct OCR processing that exactly matches the test script approach
- Modified app.py to use the direct OCR module as the default
- Fixed issues with requirements generation and display

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the application to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Push the code to a GitHub repository
   - Set up the app on Streamlit Cloud
   - Add the OpenAI API key as a secret in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Address the Streamlit button double-click issue (may require Streamlit version update)
3. Test the OpenAI API integration for requirements generation
4. Further optimize the OCR processing for better text extraction
5. Improve the graph construction algorithm for better relationship detection
6. Optimize the user interface for better usability
7. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
8. Implement persistent storage for projects
9. Add user authentication for multi-user support
10. Develop advanced features like batch processing and custom templates
